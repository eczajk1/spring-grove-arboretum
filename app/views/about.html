<h3>The Concept Plan for an Arboretum at Spring Grove</h3>

<p>The idea of an Arboretum in Catonsville has been germinating in a few seedy minds of the Village for over ten years.  In 2004, a Concept Plan for a 40 acre Arboretum on the Catonsville High School campus including the Lurman Woodland Theatre was presented to the Board of Education.  No surprise that these less than inspired bureaucrats did not want anything to do with such a community initiative.   Then, along came the Whalen Properties Promenade project and an opportunity for an even better and bigger Arboretum site on the adjacent to the Spring Grove Hospital campus.  So, heeding the seeds of change, we packed our tree trunks and moved the Arboretum concept to Asylum Drive.</p>

<p>The Spring Grove Arboretum is envisioned as a natural outdoor recreation area on a 50 acre portion of the Spring Grove Hospital Campus and adjacent Whalen property.  The site affords unending opportunities for natural riparian forests, specimen trees, ornamental and formal gardens, topiary shrubs, water features and signature sculpture.  The concept plan also includes 3 ball fields, a natural amphitheatre, as well as areas for tot lots, hike-bike trails and dog runs.  The Arboretum can also accommodate larger open spaces and facilities for the Lurman Theatre Summer Concert Series and the Catonsville July 4th Fireworks Display.</p>

<b><i>"It only takes 1 tree to create an Arboretum"</i></b>

<p>To answer the natural question of skeptics, that a grass roots arboretum effort may be unnatural if not totally unrealistic, "It only takes 1 tree to create an Arboretum", and over time that tree will grow and seed maybe even 50 acres!  Before we could even unveil this Arboretum Master Plan in January 2014, the County announced that up to $2 million is in the 2014-15 budget for the construction of a 8 acre ball field on one of the 3 sites in our Arboretum Plan - 1 down, 2 more ball fields to go!!  And, the next time you are driving through the Spring Grove campus, you might notice that all of the streets are already common tree names like Maple Avenue and Oak Avenue.  Just sayin!!!</p>

<p>The Spring Grove Arboretum is a partnership of the residents and community organizations of Catonsville and our Baltimore County and Maryland State Governments.  This partnership will include a long term lease of the 50 acres proposed for the Arboretum as well as open space funding to facilitate the demolition of buildings and pavement on the arboretum site.  This lease will allow for the operational management of the Arboretum under the Catonsville Recreation and Parks Council, an established 501c3 organization.  The Council will establish a Spring Grove Arboretum Program, administered by a Board of Directors that will report to the Council.  The Arboretum Program Board of Directors will manage the finances, development, grounds maintenance, and educational programs of the Arboretum, and with the assistance of the Rotary Club of Catonsville Foundation and the Catonsville Recreation and Parks Council will seek grants and commercial and community support to sustain and expand Arboretum facilities and programs.</p>

<p>Initial planning and funding is being facilitated by the Rotary Club of Catonsville Foundation, a 501c3 charitable organizations.  Other supporting community organizations include: the Lurman Theatre Program, the Catonsville Historical Society, the Catonsville Community Conservation Association, the Loverde Family Foundation, the Whalen family and Whalen Properties, We Love Catonsville, Inc., the Rotary Club of Catonsville Foundation, and the Catonsville Garden Club.</p>
